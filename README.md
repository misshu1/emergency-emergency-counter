## User Flows

**Employee Arriving at the Meeting Point Flow**

    1. Employee arrives to the meeting point
    2. Employee will use his card to check-in to a card reader
    3. A counter on the dashboard of the employeeâ€™s manager will increase showing how many people are at the office and check-in at the meeting point

**Manager Observing Current Stats Flow**

    1. Manager will access the web app form their mobile phone
    2. After logging in, a dashboard will be displayed showing:
      a. How many people are registered at work in the office today
      b. How many people checked-in at the meeting points
      c. How many people did not checked-in
    3. The manager can click on the number of how many people did not checked-in and see their names
    4. The dashboard should refresh automatically without the need of the manager to refresh the page

## ðŸ˜• How to use

When the employee use his card to check-in to a card reader it should open an URL with his employee Id and a cloud function or backend API will update the changes
